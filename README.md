# 3DAnatomicalRatModel
3D printable CAD model of a rat containing the most important organs and vessels as individually fillable hollow cavities: brain, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, spleen, aorta and vena cava.

The model was created with SolidWorks (Dessault Syst√®mes) and was primarily designed to be printed with the Form 2 from Formlabs Inc.  
For printing with the Form 2, the prepared .form files with an optimized orientation of the parts can be used. The model can also be fabricated with other printers using the STL files.

Advices for the model assembly: 

If the model is printed with the Form 2, the remaining resin should be removed from the thin vessels with small syringes and wires immediately after printing. 

If the organs are later filled with fluids, it is advisable to impregnate the model with Nano Seal.

The parts 2a and 2b have to be glued. In order to prevent the adhesive from running into the vessels, two pieces of wire should be inserted into the vessels as shown in the picture.

A thin layer of epoxy adhesive is then applied to the end face of part 2b and the parts are joined together. Afterwards, the cavity is also filled with adhesive as shown in the pictures.

Occasionally, the wires should be turned in order to prevent them from sticking. 

Via the luer taper fitting at the end of the vessels, a syringe can be connected. By filling the heart with the fluid and draw it up into the syringe, the vessels can be filled. 

The complete assembled model is shown in the following picture.
